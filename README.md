I am creating a social platform all universities, college, schools and other similar organizations. A place solution for
all their needs.

All student, who will be the majority of this platform, will be part of various groups like year of batch, respective
department, subject, clubs, and other similar groups which they are part of.

Groups will be automatically and are indented to facilitated better communication between other members of the group.
